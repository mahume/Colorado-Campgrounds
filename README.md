# Colorado Campgrounds

## About 

Colorado Campsites is an all in one platform when it comes to Colorado recreation. Our website provides a convenience service allowing users to find a campsite that best fits their needs. Each campsite includes a description, site-specific info, amenities, activities, photos, reviews, and weather. Users of our service will be able to provide feedback, photos, reviews, and will be able to suggest editions for any missed amenities or activities. Lastly, users will be able to submit locations suggestions for any dispersed (non-designated) campsites.
